										As a Filipino, it’s my personal dream to explain the state of class relations exhaustively. I’ll
										tell you why I have this dream. Which has been more like a fever, more like an illness. <em>Give up

												children to have been born out of struggle and out of our old house in Sampaloc, Manila, on
												Maria Cristina Street. The family had moved to Quezon City by the time I was born, among the
												lineage of Manileños who had moved from old Manila to the peri-urban sprawl of QC around the 80s
												and 90s. Here in Barangay Bagong Pag-asa, I grew up ‘protected’ enough that sometimes I’ve

											<div class="notion-simple-table-cell">There’s a Kodak photograph from 1998 that I’ve placed by my
												bookshelves: me with my grandmother, only in her late 60s then—both of us smiling at the camera,
												during a family trip we had taken to the US. More than half of her kids ended up migrating to
												the US as adults, and by that point, all my titas and titos ever wanted was to bring her abroad
												as many times as it could be possible. It was, of course, a way of showing gratitude to my
												grandmother: Mama (as we all called her) raised them as a single mother, in the old house on
												Maria Cristina Street, which had the first-floor printshop she ran as a mom-and-pop business,
												interspersed with some days she spent bottling patis to sell on the side. And a few other side
												hustles. As one of my titos once remarked, Mama worked hard so that all of them were sent to a
												private school. With Manila-born-and-raised blood, the family had the charity of a few Dominican
												priests who paid for the education of some of her sons, and many of her kids ‘made it’
												successfully in America, some doing working class jobs, some as elevated office professionals. I
												am the youngest child of Mama’s eldest daughter. For more than three decades, my mother made a
												career for herself, and during the early part of her working life, was briefly an OFW of Bank of
												America in Hong Kong. Everyone describes my grandmother (her mother) as a principled
												woman—old-school, <em>pero maprinsipyo</em>, would beat you to death in those days but never in
												front of your schoolfriends. I was almost a Grade One kid in that photo from 98—and I’ve kept
												the photograph on my wall ever since Mama died, and it’s still a fresh wound. At the funeral, I
												cried giving the speech. The eulogy that I wrote. Then my mother with no tears, without
												faltering took the next speaking role and apologized to Mama in her casket. <em>I’m sorry, Mama,
													if we took the time for your dreams.</em> It seems that no one else remembers the bottles of
												patis, except for my mother. It seems to be one of her most vivid memories of her, growing up.
												Even with all that ‘success’, my mother once confessed that she lives her dreams through me.

									the sugar industry led to numerous issues, particularly affecting the Negrenses, who lost their jobs
									and had their lands stolen by Marcos and his cronies. Furthermore, Marcos failed to address the
									persistent malnutrition issues, exacerbating the province-wide crisis and resulting in widespread
									famine and hunger-related deaths. Not even the powerful founding sugar barons or the elites of the
									land were left untouched during these crises.
									In mourning for all the tragedies that had struck their homeland, the city’s residents and government
									came together to commemorate the pain and suffering they had endured.
									Despite this, Bacolod became known as the “City of Smiles” after the formation of Masskara. Hidden
									beneath the smiling masks lies the sadness of Bacoleños.
