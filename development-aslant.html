										</b>The walk through the university gates—any university gates—feels unusually long. One afternoon I
										walked out of the halls, passed beyond the gates, and the entrance and exit out of the university
										made me vow only to be in places where people are actually talking. And I began to think the best
										way to go about undoing the regime of global business is by ‘disarming’ the university: that is,
										deconstructing and clarifying its current role in global society, its machineries and entrenchments,
										and its own history of development. Disarming it as a way to court infinitude. Capitalist economic
										imaginaries are schooled, supplied, and sustained by the university. As with intelligence—needs a
										lot of breaking.</div>

												social workers, some might be government workers. Some might just be curious and interested in
												this topic. And there are varying levels of appreciation. And I think part of the experiment
												here is also bringing in a lot of these fields together under this idea of ‘school’. So I wanted
												to start with some creative prompting for a little bit, if you’ll allow me, and why exactly I’ve
												been personally interested in thinking about the concept and the idea of the university. It’s a
												little complex, perhaps, to trace the origins of the university, and so I personally offer to do
												it here by a little modest meandering—in kind of the way we pick up a book from a shelf and read
												it. The way that we might discover something simply by accident.</div>

											<div class="notion-simple-table-cell">One of my favorite writers, the poet Anne Carson, in 1998
												once gave actually a talk precisely about this topic: “The Idea of the University”. One of her
												main sources when she was trying to think about this topic, as she was tracing the university to
												the Medieval Age, was actually the work of a Catholic theologian from the 1800s, Cardinal John
												Henry Newman—so medieval times pa ‘to—who took a very close look at the word “university” in an
												essay, where he defined that “A university by its very name professes to teach universal
												knowledge.” And as Carson recounts in that quite poetic talk, the idea of universal knowledge,
												she says, and I’ll read an excerpt from that work, “rests upon a principle that frees it to be
												useless. This reason need look for no end outside itself. Its value is intrinsic.” And so
												Newman’s ideal university is a place where you may “reason for no reason.” And in that talk,
												Anne Carson, being the slanted sort of writer and thinker that she is, as I too learned from
												her, in fact moves on to end that talk more with riddles, saying, “You can never stop trying to
												come to grips with the idea of the university.”</div>

											<div class="notion-simple-table-cell">These days, the university has all reason to reason,
												including to do so for no reason. To persist and to resist. As some of us may know, it is under
												threat, under pressure from various angles, not only to exist, but to participate and sometimes
												even justify itself in the social sphere, the public and civic domain. As Anne Carson said,
												those of us who engage in intellectual work and teaching and forms of study, whether we’re
												students or teachers or something else, we may always be “coming to grips” with that meaning of
												a university education or education broadly in our lives. Of course, that term is also, you
												know, very specifically different in weight and meaning: the word “university” is far more
												self-declarative in its importance as well as prestige than let’s say a college. And so today
												you get the sense that the university has actually drifted from some of its perhaps core
												principles of mission in education and knowledge. And in some cases, in fact, might be seen more
												like a luxury commodity or a scarce status symbol, as much as it is also a stepping stone for
												economic and social opportunity. And the university is also never just a university.</div>

												interest in thinking about this has a lot to do with what I might have thought I was supposed to
												be doing when I was a college student. And through <em>slant school</em>, of course. As we know
												many writers, artists, and intellectuals, they’re educated and sometimes miseducated as they
												need these spaces of learning and of study. And you know, eventually, throughout years of
												working in a very professional field, for the most part actually unrelated to my degree, I opted
												to intensively pursue a graduate education to actually broach questions, some underlying
												spiritual questions, that have all to do with the question of <em>work</em>. The question of
												labor. And the question of what it means to be able to do work that could be essential and
												meaningful to our lives, and therefore how, again, the social order (particularly in my case
												around me, as I knew it and partly inherited as institutional forces) prepares us for living our
												life for supposedly meaningful work.</div>

												does it mean to be a student for you? So think back or think on your college years, your time in
												and around university, what is that emotional landscape of lived experience like? What questions
												were or are you asking yourself? What is it like that you had or have this identity of being a
												student? An identity by no means strictly a color or race, let’s say, but that <em>poetic
												</em>identity of a promise. And that <em>social </em>identity of your own labor, in fact, as a
												student. And maybe even your own <em>class </em>or social class as a student—which would be very
												different for everybody. So what was that time like? What did you hope for? What kinds of
												questions did you have about yourself, work, and the world? How has your life changed since
												asking those questions and then living them? In that time and state of being a student. Let’s
												just maybe take a few minutes more. As you orient yourself to that, disarm yourselves to that,

												The walk through the university gates—any university gates—feels unusually long. One afternoon I
												walked out of the halls, passed beyond the gates, and the entrance and exit out of the
												university made me vow only to be in places where people are actually talking. And I began to
												think the best way to go about undoing the regime of global business is by ‘disarming’ the
												university: that is, deconstructing and clarifying its current role in global society, its
												machineries and entrenchments, and its own history of development. Disarming it as a way to
												court infinitude. Capitalist economic imaginaries are schooled, supplied, and sustained by the
												university. As with intelligence—needs a lot of breaking.</div>

											<div class="notion-simple-table-cell">Okay, I’ll go first. So I’ll do this in three parts. The
												first is maybe I’ll just talk a bit about my experience as a high school student, what I think
												it means to be a student right now, and what I hope it could mean going into college in a few
												months. So maybe the part of my education that I can talk about right now is just the last two
												years—so maybe I can talk a bit about the K-12 program because it’s kind of the closest
												experience I’ve had to being a university student, or to kind of deciding what I want in terms
												of, you know, my future career, et cetera. For my introduction: I was under the humanities and
												social sciences strand. The goal of the program really is just to kind of prime you, like not
												even just for college, but it’s even to already prime you for the workplace and the workforce.
												It ‘outs itself’ as like kind of translating theory into practice, more practical or managerial
												skills. So in my time, I think I kind of went into the humanities and social sciences strand,
												hoping that it would kind of affirm that choice I made in life, that being a humanitarian is
												much more than just being in HR, for example. And it’s kind of introduced me to greater theories
												or greater ideas of the world that have existed and have been developed throughout history.

											<div class="notion-simple-table-cell">But you know, I went to a Catholic school, it was a private

												was intuitively kind of opposed to it, or that is seen as the antithesis to like more, you know,
												corporate strands or more business-oriented strands like ABM [Accounting, Business, and
												Management], for example. Even then, choosing the strand, we were kind of made to fit a more
												corporate role, or to fit status quo, and adjust our dreams in that way. So even in our subject,
												we had a subject that was called “work immersion”, which basically promised to turn theory into
												practice, to turn us into social workers. Even in the subject, the kind of thing that we learned
												was more like managerial roles. Our goal really was to construct project proposals that were
												acceptable to our Catholic administration—instead of, you know, actually having dialogue with
												humanitarian organizations or actually like creating something that, you know, we are passionate
												about, that we know the true impact of. Instead, because we’re more focused on organizing events
												and more of learning the bureaucratic process of getting things approved, we were kind of

												removed and sort of dispassionate, which completely shattered my idea of, you know, the
												humanities, because I went through it with like a completely different idea. And instead, I was
												told that, no, this is what you’re going to learn. Even though I’m still engaging with
												organizations or political speakers, for example, the thing that they wanted us to learn was
												more how to file papers. So to me, that kind of shattered my idea of what it means to be a
												student and what I was kind of preparing for. To me is kind of what being a student is right
												now, right? A lot of our incentives to do things and to learn: it’s a lot less about these
												greater ideas of like how it fuels our life, or building a love for books or creation. You know
												the incentive to be a student is more about these more artificial and more short-term
												incentives—things like a grade, for example, or developing like practical skills for when we
												later go into the job market. And I guess what I want as a student or what I want the meaning of
												a student to be is something that’s different from that. Because I think all of these other
												things that we value, things like good grades or things like practical skills, I think these are
												kind of like inherently tied to greater ideas of fulfillment. Completing a task isn’t just
												important because we were told to complete a task but because sometimes they have actual value
												that’s tied to it. And so I think that’s what I want being a student to mean. And I want that to
												be first and foremost. And I don’t want that to be preceded by all of these other more socially

												end the conversation with this quote, this very corny quote, “Desire is the root of all
												suffering.” I think college has been this endless desire for connection, for knowledge, for a

												bleak, given you know the current social political condition, trying to reconcile those desires

												your work, including in something like <em>The Undercommons </em>where you’re sort of stratified
												against these systems of administration and bureaucracy and these kind of legitimate structures.
												And so I guess, you know, that body of work has been and these kinds of concerns seem to
												have—I’m almost taken aback with how Ramya and Ninon shared it earlier, it feels like it might
												have gotten worse you know since I was in undergrad! So I want to ask Stefano how you see that
												kind of <em>critique </em>of those kinds of institutional forms, how has that maybe changed for

												a teacher and the ways that you kind of socialize that in other ways, in your work.</div>

												And maybe they didn’t even want one. So if you look at a kind of famous moment where the
												university is sort of coming together in early modern Europe, there’s a very famous strike in
												Bologna, which is one of the very early universities in Europe and Italy, is starting to bring
												study <em>inside</em>. Its own walls, its own institution. And there’s a strike by the students,
												which really comes down to this problem: they really don’t want this knowledge to be enclosed in
												this way. And at the time, this part of Italy was controlled by the Spanish crown, and then the
												Spanish crown, something you would be unfortunately familiar with in the Philippines, sends a
												guy called [Juan Ginés de] Sepúlveda. Sepúlveda is a figure from colonialism in the Americas
												that we know very well. He goes and he crushes a student strike in Bologna, and through crushing
												it, further institutionalizes the idea of the university as the place where you go to study.
												It’s the kind of place that is recognized. And there’s lots of other things going on, I’m
												simplifying things. Parts of the Catholic Church are getting nervous about some of these
												itinerant sort of teachers, et cetera. Well, today they would call it institution building, but
												we might prefer to call it <em>enclosure</em>. In a more negative sense. Where things start to

												Spain. They had a big debate on whether Indigenous people had souls, whether they were human,
												what the position should be. And of course, Sepovedra won, and his position was, ‘they convert

											<div class="notion-simple-table-cell">But of course, there’s always been resistance and
												alternatives to that. And I’ll just tell you one from my experience, but you know plenty from
												your own experiences, I’m sure, too. In the US, there was a great geographer called Clyde Woods,
												who died a few years ago. Clyde Woods had this um idea about how knowledge continued to be
												developed and used inside enslaved African enslaved peoples’ communities in the United States.
												And he referred to this as “blues epistemology” and blues is the music, blues. And for him, this
												was an affirmation that study—that knowledge, sharing, and forms of invention—continued even
												under this incredible hardship. And then he wrote a second book and he started talking about
												what he called blues universities. And by ‘blues universities’, now he was talking about New
												Orleans, he said, well, you know, where could Black people study? They couldn’t go near the
												universities, they couldn’t do any of those things. But they found places to study. They studied
												in the storefront church. They studied in the juke joint bar. They studied in the barbecue in
												the yard. They studied on the front porches. And he called those places, blues universities.

												institution as this sort of place where, you know, you have to get a job. You have to be useful
												to capitalism. And I’m curious about that particularly in some concepts that you’ve explored
												before and maybe your own experience as well—having actually taught in Singapore Management
												University, for instance, where you’re sort of in that core of a capitalist order, right. And I
												also want to mention this in part because it’s sort of the bump that we kind of face in our
												lives. You get your degree or you’re having your degree, you’re studying and you’re like, oh
												man, like I have to do I have to be useful in this way, right? And of course, it’s different,
												it’s configured differently for any type of university—whether that’s a private institution or a
												public university, and certainly for, let’s say, a polytechnic university, it’s also configured
												very differently. But it’s all sort of matrix into this normal idea, right, that there’s an
												industry to be served. And of course, all of the entrenchments there, right: that’s everything

											<div class="notion-simple-table-cell">There was a lot to say about obviously about the moment that
												we’re in whether it’s teaching in business school, or studying art and management, or preparing
												to come into a sociology program or whatever. But I find myself kind of going back a bit to
												answer your question so I apologize for that. But I think part of what I was trying to say about
												by exploring these kind of early origins of the university is that we then see a transition once
												it’s been organized from it largely being, you know, part of a kind of arm of the state and the
												church, to the next big project of the state and the church in Europe which is colonialism. And
												then it starts to become an arm of colonialism. For instance, if you think about these big
												American universities, what they call the Ivy League universities—you know we’re only now doing
												the research and getting the information to understand how much they are built on slavery, how
												much they were slave owners, what their relationship was to Indigenous people. So the university
												transitions into this very secular, very worldly thing, even while all along it’s talking about
												the opposite. About being a place where they’re going to train priests, being a place where
												they’re going to uphold values, et cetera. Actually, they’re in the middle of all this stuff.
												And then of course from there, you get another generation of universities which arise in the
												late 19th century and into the 20th century in which, as you're pointing to, Carissa, now you
												need universities who can help with the new kinds of workforces that are developing under
												capitalism. So all the big state universities in the United States that you might be aware of,
												you know, in one sense or another, a lot of them are called land grant universities. And they’re
												really set up with the idea of the development of agriculture and other industries—extractive
												industries, in the parts of the United States that have now been taken over and fully you know
												almost fully purged of native people, et cetera.</div>

												for four years and really think to yourself, I’m studying humanity. That’s what I've done. I
												haven’t had to do management. I haven’t had to think about accounting. I haven’t had to think
												about these things. But then you would walk out and you’d walk into that management job. Now
												that shifted because, at that time, management class was a smaller class. And all they really

												things going on there. They’ve cut a lot of DEI programs and things like that, which also makes

												of any high school can get into the university. And some context with Texas is that, your public
												school is very much determined on where you live and how much like socioeconomic mobility is
												there. So say you’re from like a rich high school or something, those kids will automatically
												get there. But because it’s all of the high schools, no matter what high school you go to, even
